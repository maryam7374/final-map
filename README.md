## How It Started
- I Began with a basic HTML file
- I used YouTube tutorials to learn how to work with an HTML file, Although I already had some exprience with writing HTML code. 
- I uploaded basemaps from https://leafletjs.com/ website.
- I used from "Overpass turbo" website and also geojson.io to demonstrate the restaurants locations.
## Key Features
- I wanted to demonstrate an "Interactive map with restaurant locations"
- The map includes 20 Restaurants around the city center of Salzburg
- Vegan/vegetarian options marked
- filter option based on the type of the food and restaurant is provided on the map
## How It Works
- I started by creating a basic HTML file since I already had some experience with HTML.
- Then, with the help of AI, I separated the JavaScript and CSS code from the HTML into their own files (script.js and style.css).
- The map is built using Leaflet.js, and it appears inside the <div id="map"> container in the HTML.
- Restaurant locations are shown as markers on the map, each with different icons based on the type of restaurant.
- I added a filter option so users can see restaurants based on food types like vegan or vegetarian.
- Clicking on a restaurant marker shows more information about it.
## Fixes and Enhancements
I tried the “locate me” option, but it gave many errors at first. So, I manually set the city center coordinates of Salzburg as the map’s central point.This helped the location show much more accurately on the map.
## Improvements After Feedback
At first, I didn’t use metadata or a scale on the map. But after your initial review, I added those features.
I also changed the restaurant icons based on your feedback — I made them a bit more advanced and moved away from simple circle shapes.
Plus, I added two different basemaps for the map to make it look nicer and more attractive.
## Results of Fixation and Improvement after Feedback 
These changes made the map more user-friendly, accurate, and visually appealing.
